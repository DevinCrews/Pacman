# **Pacman Moving**
 
 Getting **PacMan** to move across the screen with edge detection. 
 
 # **Description**
 
 
 Using edge detection and set interval function togther I was able to get to a picture 
 of PacMan chomping his way across the screen and when he gets to the end of the screen
 he turns around and comes the other way.
